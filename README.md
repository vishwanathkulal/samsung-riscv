The provided images illustrate the process of writing, compiling, and analyzing a C program in a Linux-based virtual machine environment. The program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to \( n \), where \( n \) is predefined as 100. The source code is written in a text editor (leafpad), saved as sum1ton.c, and compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc). Once compiled, the program is executed in the terminal, displaying the result. Additionally, the assembly-level representation of the compiled code is analyzed using tools like objdump. This disassembly provides a detailed view of the low-level instructions corresponding to the main function of the program, including register operations, additions, and function calls like printf. The workflow demonstrates the stages of C program compilation and execution, starting from high-level code to machine-understandable assembly, showcasing the tools and techniques commonly used in software development and debugging in a controlled virtual machine environment.
